Hi there! I'm Allegra. I am a lifelong learner with a strong passion for using data to understand the world around us.
Currently, I'm a PhD student in Stanford's chemical engineering department, and my research focuses on sustainable energy. 
Using supercomputers, we simulate materials to study their catalytic behavior. 
The deeper intuition we gain into what makes a material
catalytically active allows us to come up with predictive models and expedite the discovery of new catalysts. 

This blog will serve as playground for side projects of mine, and I hope it may also be a useful teaching tool for other learners!
